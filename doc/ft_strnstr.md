## Description
**strnstr** â€” locate a substring in a string
The **strnstr** function locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string \c little in the string \c big, where not more than \c len characters are searched. Characters that appear after a \0 character are not searched. Since the **strnstr** function is a FreeBSD specific API, it should only be used when portability is not a concern.

## Declaration
```c
	char ft_strnstr(const char *srcstr, const char *search, size_t size_cmp)
```

## Return Value

If search is an empty string, big is returned; if little occurs nowhere in big, NULL is
returned; otherwise a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of little is
returned.
